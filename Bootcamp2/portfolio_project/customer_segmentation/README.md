### Instructions on how to execute the code in the notebooks
1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill out the environment vars. You can also just copy the `.env` file from week15, but PLEASE DO NOT SHARE OR PUSH ANY PASSWORDS and make sure your [.gitignore](https://github.com/shaq31415926/waia-academy/blob/main/.gitignore) file includes the `.env` file.
2. You can either add the definitions to connect to redshift to a separate python file and then import this python script in your notebooks or you can just copy the definition on [connecting to redshift](https://github.com/shaq31415926/waia-academy/blob/main/Bootcamp2/portfolio_project/customer_segmentation/src/connect_to_redshift.py) directly to your notebooks.
